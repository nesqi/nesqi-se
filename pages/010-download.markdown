v1.0

Version 1.0 is finally here! The GUI is rewritten from scratch using the C++
library [gtkmm](http://www.gtkmm.org/) and is opimized for playing on a remote
computer. Here follows a list of changes since v0.3.3.

New in this version:

- New clean X GUI.
- You can change the layout of the board.
- The board is scalable.
- Graphics are optimized to perform better over a remote connection.
- The computer indicates what his next move will be.
- Progressbars are used to indicate the scores.
- GUI uses GTK+2.

v0.3, v0.3.1, v0.3.2, v0.3.3
---

Great looking X support and many bugs removed! Bugs in v0.2 forced me to make
the file format incompatible with the one used in v0.3. I don't think this
should be a problem. Has someone ever used the save function in v0.2?

This is the first version that actually is user friendly! It's even fun to play
the game now. ENJOY!

v 0.2 (old version)
---

This version is MUCH more mature than 0.1 but it only has support for running
in the console. No X server support. This will be included in the next version
though. "configure" script included.

v. 0.1 (old version)
---

This version is a first prototype and somewhat ugly/buggy. It has support for
both the console and X windows. It's only possible to play against the computer
and there is no time-out function for the computer if it thinks for to long.
However this is no problem for me. I can't win even on level 4!

This version has no "configure" script so it might be a bit harder to compile.
It works on my Linux Slackware 8.0 dist.
