Hexxagon

Hexxagon is a board game that I played allot when I was younger. There was a
particular [DOS implementation](http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/hexxagon/)
of the game that I sometimes spent hours playing.  As I moved over to Linux I
noticed that there was no Hexxagon implementation available and so I ended up
writing one.

Hexxagon is implemented in C++ using gtkmm. Itâ€™s only distributed as source
code with build scripts but many distributions like ubuntu and debian have
packages made ready for installation.
